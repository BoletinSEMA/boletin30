</p><!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   This thesis presents some novel contributions within the framework of multilayer
shallow-water models and well-balanced high order numerical schemes. In the ﬁrst
place, a multilayer shallow-water model with variable density is derived. A particular
state equation is chosen such that the model can be written in terms of its relative
density. The model is derived under the hydrostatic assumption for the pressure and
consist on a system of partial diﬀerential equations with non-conservative products
and source terms. As it is usual in multilayer systems, a closure relation is needed
for the vertical transference terms, which are then expressed in terms of horizontal
velocities. Finally, the model presents some stationary solutions that go beyond the usual
lake-at-rest type stationary solutions. Since the model admits density ﬂuctuations,
stationary solutions corresponding to a vertical stratiﬁcation in relative density are also
possible. However, due to the multilayer shallow-water approach, the vertical proﬁle
depends on the given topography and the number of layers chosen. This may be
seen as a discrete version for the multilayer approach for such vertical stratiﬁcation
proﬁle.
</p><!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >   A complete review of the existing techniques regarding ﬁnite volume methods based on
path-conservative Riemann solvers and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods is also included.
Of particular interest is the novel contribution of this thesis where a general strategy to
design well-balanced DG methods for general systems of balanced laws is given. The
strategy includes a limiting technique that preserves the well-balanced property of
the numerical scheme. Moreover, it is compatible with several time discretization
methods, such as ADER or Runge-Kutta. It has been successfully tested with the
Burgers’ equation, the Euler equations with gravity and the one layer shallow-water
equations.
</p><!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   The next step consists on providing numerical discretizations for the multilayer
shallow-water model with variable density. The discretization proposed here is based on the
ﬁnite volume method and the discontinuous Galerkin method, and both of them are novel
contributions of this thesis. The ﬁnite volume method provides a second-order accurate
approximation of the PDE system by means of a hydrostatic reconstruction that is able to
preserve the water at rest solution with constant density and also, non-trivial stationary
solutions corresponding to a vertical stratiﬁcation of relative density. Likewise, the DG based
numerical discretization allows for arbitrary high order in space and time in one step thanks to



the use of the ADER-DG technique. This approach is also well-balanced for trivial
and non-trivial stationary solutions. The limiting strategy is based on the MOOD
paradigm, with a proper switching between the DG solver and a robust ﬁnite volume
solver.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   Finally, several numerical experiments are proposed that seek to prove the accuracy and
robustness of the proposed numerical discretizations. They include a test studying the
order of accuracy, where it can be seen that the desired order is achieved for both
numerical solvers. Several well-balanced tests are also discussed. Non-trivial stationary
solutions are not only preserved, but even recovered after a small perturbation. Next,
several experiments are considered, including a lock exchange in relative density and a
comparison with experimental data, where the numerical results yield excellent data
agreement. The last experiment corresponds to a lock exchange in a two-dimensional
channel.
</p><!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   As closure and in order to go beyond the results already presented, two appendices are
included. The ﬁrst one addresses the numerical implementation in two dimensional domains of
the ﬁnite volume method proposed in this thesis for the multilayer shallow-water model with
variable density. The second appendix explains the parallelization performed in CPU and in
GPU, including a comparison of diﬀerent parallelization strategies running in several hardware
architectures.

</p><!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   This PhD thesis addresses the numerical simulation of models that simulate the behavior of
turbulent ﬂows through reduced-order techniques. We use the Smagorinsky model, which
is a large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence model. The primary objective of this
dissertation is to build <span
class="ecti-1000">a posteriori </span>error bounds for the ﬁnite element - reduced order
solution of the Smagorinsky turbulence model in order to build the Reduced Basis (RB)
Model.
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   The thesis is divided into two parts. In the ﬁrst part, we seek for the application of <span
class="ecti-1000">a</span>
<span
class="ecti-1000">posteriori </span>error bound estimator following the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart (BRR) theory
of non-singular branches approximation of parametric non-linear problems to an



optimal design problem of a cloister. In the second part, we seek to extend to the
unsteady Smagorinsky model the techniques to construct RB solvers developed for
steady problems and we propose another estimator based upon the Kolmogórov
theory.
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   In Chapter 1, we introduce concepts that are used along the thesis such that diﬀerence
ROM techniques, auxiliary results and the application of <span
class="ecti-1000">a posteriori </span>error bound estimator for
a 3D case. We consider the lid-driven cavity problem and we build a RB model, reducing the
computational time from 2 hours to only 2 seconds.



</p><!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   <span
class="ecbx-1000">Part I</span>
</p><!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   Cloisters are a kind of courtyard widespread in old buildings such as cathedrals and
monasteries. We are interested in the optimal thermal comfort design of the cloister, studying
the dynamics of the air that ﬂows into the courtyard by forced convection model, as a ﬁrst
approximation to our problem. We study how the dimensions of the corridor around the cloister
aﬀects to the ﬂow in the cloister. To do this, we build a RB model using the width and the
height of the corridor as parameters.
</p><!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   In Chapter 2, we consider the ﬂuid dynamics only in 2D. We develop the RB problem
building an <span
class="ecti-1000">a posteriori </span>error bound estimator following the BRR theory for velocity and
pressure. We are able to obtain the distribution of velocity, pressure, and temperature in barely
<span
class="cmr-10">1</span><span
class="cmmi-10">,</span><span
class="cmr-10">5 </span>second in stead of <span
class="cmr-10">3</span><span
class="cmmi-10">,</span><span
class="cmr-10">5 </span>minutes with low error levels.
</p><!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   In Chapter 3, we add the temperature to the problem using a forced convection model. We
build the RB problem developing an <span
class="ecti-1000">a posteriori </span>error bound estimator for temperature,
following now standard techniques since the problem is linear.
</p><!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   We design a functional to minimize the temperature in the ground ﬂoor in terms of the
geometrical parameters and we computed the value of this functional for <span
class="cmr-10">625 </span>pairs of
parameters in less than <span
class="cmr-10">16 </span>minutes. We obtain an optimum design that optimizes the thermal
comfort in the lower part (to be occupied by people) of the cloister.
</p><!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   <span
class="ecbx-1000">Part II</span>
</p><!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   The main goal of this part is to build RB based upon error estimators for the unsteady
Smagorinsky turbulence model.
</p><!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >   In Chapter 4, we develop <span
class="ecti-1000">a priori </span>estimates for velocity and pressure for the time-space
discrete Smagorinsky model. These results are the key to apply the BRR theory in the next
chapter.
</p><!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   In Chapter 5, we are able to apply the BRR theory for the development of <span
class="ecti-1000">a posteriori </span>error
bound estimator, not without ﬁnding diﬃculties. The key is the deﬁnition of the norm related
to the problem. Unfortunately, the computation of the Stability Factor, necessary for the
computation of the <span
class="ecti-1000">a posteriori </span>estimator, is not low-cost, and it is necessary the
implementation of further techniques to reduce the complexity.
</p><!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   In Chapter 6, we introduce the <span
class="ecti-1000">a posteriori </span>error estimator based upon the Kolmogórov
theory. The continuous problem should achieve a speciﬁc energy spectrum, since the full-order
model is intended to be a good approximation of the continuous problem, it should also achieve
this energy spectrum in the resolved part of the inertial spectrum. To validate the estimate, we
develop an academic test in which we compare the use of the Kolmogórov estimator with the
use of the error between the full order and reduced order solution to develop the
RB problem. The test is based on a problem for which we obtain a velocity ﬁeld
that satisﬁes the <span
class="cmsy-10">−</span><span
class="cmr-10">5</span><span
class="cmmi-10">∕</span><span
class="cmr-10">3 </span>law, and we build an RB problem using the POD+Greedy
strategy. The number of basis functions and the error are similar to those obtained using
the true error as “error estimator”, which indicates that the estimate works in this
case.
</p><!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   All numerical tests presented in this thesis have been coded in FreeFem++ v. 4.8.
Due to the complexity of the numerical tests, we use parallel computation using the
PETSc package and MPI (Message Passing Interface). Every oﬄine phase has been
performed in the cluster <span
class="ecti-1000">Anonimus2021 </span>which allows a High Performance Computation
(HPC).
